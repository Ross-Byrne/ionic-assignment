Second Year Mobile Programming college project

Using Ionic Version: 1.0.0-rc.4 Codename: sulfur-suricate.

Continued development of the app can be found here: https://github.com/Ross-Byrne/CalorieCounter

#Calorie Counter

First of all - ran out of time due to bugs with ionic, so you cannot change the names of the food that is added, they are all placeholders "Bread" with 100 calories. The calories DO however work correctly, they do add on to the calories consumed.

#Instructions

The app calculates your daily calorie needs, this is only an estimate!

First the app calculates your personal basal metabolic rate or BMR.
Then, the app uses this, with your activity levels (5 options in app), to determine your
daily calorie needs.

The app asks for your name, gender, weight in KG, height in CM, age in years and your activity level.
All of these details (other then name) are used to calculate your daily calorie needs.
Your details can be deleted.

#Thoughts

The settings page is very well done and complete in my opinion, I am very happy with it.
The Home page is also complete and I am resonably happy with it.
The Calories page is not complete due to bugs with ionic and time limits.
The page is about 60% - 70% finished. I am very unhappy that I was unable to complete it in time.
